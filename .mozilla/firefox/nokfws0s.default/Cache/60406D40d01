<H1><A NAME="SEC269" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC269">Dired, the Directory Editor</A></H1>
<P>
  Dired makes an Emacs buffer containing a listing of a directory, and
optionally some of its subdirectories as well.  You can use the normal
Emacs commands to move around in this buffer, and special Dired commands
to operate on the files listed.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC270" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC270">Entering Dired</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX1434"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1435"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1436"></A>
<P>
  To invoke Dired, do <KBD>C-x d</KBD> or <KBD>M-x dired</KBD>.  The command reads
a directory name or wildcard file name pattern as a minibuffer argument
to specify which files to list.  Where <CODE>dired</CODE> differs from
<CODE>list-directory</CODE> is in putting the buffer into Dired mode so that
the special commands of Dired are available.
<P>
  The variable <CODE>dired-listing-switches</CODE> specifies the options to
give to <CODE>ls</CODE> for listing directory; this string <EM>must</EM> contain
<SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>.  If you use a numeric prefix argument with the <CODE>dired</CODE>
command, you can specify the <CODE>ls</CODE> switches with the minibuffer
after you finish entering the directory specification.
<A NAME="IDX1437"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1438"></A>
<P>
  To display the Dired buffer in another window rather than in the
selected window, use <KBD>C-x 4 d</KBD> (<CODE>dired-other-window)</CODE> instead
of <KBD>C-x d</KBD>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC271" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC271">Commands in the Dired Buffer</A></H2>
<P>
    The Dired buffer is "read-only", and inserting text in it is not
useful, so ordinary printing characters such as <KBD>d</KBD> and <KBD>x</KBD> are
used for special Dired commands.  Some Dired commands <DFN>mark</DFN> or
<DFN>flag</DFN> the <DFN>current file</DFN> (that is, the file on the current
line); other commands operate on the marked files or on the flagged
files.
<A NAME="IDX1439"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1440"></A>
<P>
  All the usual Emacs cursor motion commands are available in Dired
buffers.  Some special purpose cursor motion commands are also
provided.  The keys <KBD>C-n</KBD> and <KBD>C-p</KBD> are redefined to put the
cursor at the beginning of the file name on the line, rather than at the
beginning of the line.
<A NAME="IDX1441"></A>
<P>
  For extra convenience, <KBD>SPC</KBD> and <KBD>n</KBD> in Dired are equivalent
to <KBD>C-n</KBD>.  <KBD>p</KBD> is equivalent to <KBD>C-p</KBD>.  (Moving by lines is
so common in Dired that it deserves to be easy to type.)  <KBD>DEL</KBD>
(move up and unflag) is often useful simply for moving up.

<H2><A NAME="SEC272" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC272">Deleting Files with Dired</A></H2>
<P>
  The primary use of Dired is to <DFN>flag</DFN> files for deletion and then
delete the files previously flagged.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><KBD>d</KBD>
<DD>Flag this file for deletion.
<DT><KBD>u</KBD>
<DD>Remove deletion flag on this line.
<DT><KBD><KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Move point to previous line and remove the deletion flag on that line.

(see section <A HREF="emacs_19.html#SEC100">Backup Files</A>).
<DT><KBD>. (Period)</KBD>
<DD>Flag excess numeric backup files for deletion.  The oldest and newest
few backup files of any one file are exempt; the middle ones are flagged.
<P>
<DT><KBD>% d <VAR>regexp</VAR> <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Flag for deletion all files whose names match the regular expression
<VAR>regexp</VAR> (<CODE>dired-flag-files-regexp</CODE>).  This is just like <KBD>%
m</KBD> except that it uses <SAMP>`D'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> to mark the files.
<P>
Only the non-directory part of the file name is used in matching.  Use
<SAMP>`^'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> to anchor matches.  Exclude subdirectories by
hiding them (see section <A HREF="emacs_32.html#SEC281">Hiding Subdirectories</A>).
</DL>
<A NAME="IDX1444"></A>
<P>
  You can flag a file for deletion by moving to the line describing the
file and typing <KBD>d</KBD>.  The deletion flag is visible as a <SAMP>`D'</SAMP> at
the beginning of the line.  This command moves point to the beginning of
the next line, so that repeated <KBD>d</KBD> commands flag successive files.
<A NAME="IDX1445"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1446"></A>
<P>
  The files are flagged for deletion rather than deleted immediately to
reduce the danger of deleting a file accidentally.  Until you direct
Dired to expunge the flagged files, you can remove deletion flags using
the commands <KBD>u</KBD> and <KBD>DEL</KBD>.  <KBD>u</KBD> works just like <KBD>d</KBD>,
but removes flags rather than making flags.  <KBD>DEL</KBD> moves upward,
removing flags; it is like <KBD>u</KBD> with numeric argument automatically
negated.
<A NAME="IDX1447"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1448"></A>
<P>
  To delete the flagged files, type <KBD>x</KBD> (<CODE>dired-expunge</CODE>).
This command first displays a list of all the file names flagged for
deletion, and requests confirmation with <KBD>yes</KBD>.  Once you confirm,
<KBD>x</KBD> deletes all the flagged files, then deletes their lines from the
text of the Dired buffer.  The shortened Dired buffer remains selected.
<P>
  If you answer <KBD>no</KBD> or quit with <KBD>C-g</KBD> when asked to confirm, you
return immediately to Dired, with the deletion flags still present in
the buffer, and no files actually deleted.
<A NAME="IDX1449"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1450"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1451"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1452"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1453"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1454"></A>
<P>
  The <KBD>#</KBD>, <KBD>~</KBD> and <KBD>.</KBD> commands flag many files for
deletion, based on their file names.  These commands are useful
precisely because they do not actually delete any files; you can remove
the deletion flags from any flagged files that you really wish to
keep.<P>
  <KBD>#</KBD> flags for deletion all files whose names look like auto-save
files (see section <A HREF="emacs_19.html#SEC106">Auto-Saving: Protection Against Disasters</A>)---that is, files whose names begin and end
with <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>.  <KBD>~</KBD> flags for deletion all files whose names say
they are backup files (see section <A HREF="emacs_19.html#SEC100">Backup Files</A>)---that is, whose names end in
<SAMP>`~'</SAMP>.
<A NAME="IDX1455"></A>
<P>
  <KBD>.</KBD> (Period) flags just some of the backup files for deletion: all
but the oldest few and newest few backups of any one file.  Normally
<CODE>dired-kept-versions</CODE> (<STRONG>not</STRONG> <CODE>kept-new-versions</CODE>; that
applies only when saving) specifies the number of newest versions of
each file to keep, and <CODE>kept-old-versions</CODE> specifies the number of
oldest versions to keep.
<P>
  Period with a positive numeric argument, as in <KBD>C-u 3 .</KBD>,
specifies the number of newest versions to keep, overriding
<CODE>dired-kept-versions</CODE>.  A negative numeric argument overrides
<CODE>kept-old-versions</CODE>, using minus the value of the argument to
specify the number of oldest versions of each file to keep.
<A NAME="IDX1456"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1457"></A>
<P>
  The <KBD>% d</KBD> command flags all files whose names match a specified
regular expression (<CODE>dired-flag-files-regexp</CODE>).  Only the
non-directory part of the file name is used in matching.  You can use
<SAMP>`^'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> to anchor matches.  You can exclude subdirectories
by hiding them (see section <A HREF="emacs_32.html#SEC281">Hiding Subdirectories</A>).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC273" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC273">Visiting Files in Dired</A></H2>
<P>
  There are several Dired commands for visiting or examining the files
listed in the Dired buffer.  All of them apply to the current line's
file; if that file is really a directory, these commands invoke Dired on
that subdirectory (using a separate Dired buffer).
<P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>f</KBD>
<DD>Visit the file described on the current line, like typing <KBD>C-x C-f</KBD>
and supplying that file name (<CODE>dired-find-file</CODE>).  See section <A HREF="emacs_19.html#SEC98">Visiting Files</A>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1460"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1461"></A>
<DT><KBD>o</KBD>
<DD>Like <KBD>f</KBD>, but uses another window to display the file's buffer
(<CODE>dired-find-file-other-window</CODE>).  The Dired buffer remains visible
in the first window.  This is like using <KBD>C-x 4 C-f</KBD> to visit the
file.  See section <A HREF="emacs_21.html#SEC133">Multiple Windows</A>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1462"></A>

<DT><KBD>v</KBD>
<DD>View the file described on the current line, using <KBD>M-x view-file</KBD>
(<CODE>dired-view-file</CODE>).
<P>
Viewing a file is like visiting it, but is slanted toward moving around
in the file conveniently and does not allow changing the file.
See section <A HREF="emacs_19.html#SEC126">Miscellaneous File Operations</A>.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC274" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC274">Dired Marks vs. Flags</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX1466"></A>
<P>
  Instead of flagging a file with <SAMP>`D'</SAMP>, you can <DFN>mark</DFN> the file
with some other character (usually <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>).  Most Dired commands other
than "expunge" (<KBD>x</KBD>) operate on files marked with <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>.
<P>
  Here are some commands for marking with <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> (and also for
unmarking).  (See section <A HREF="emacs_32.html#SEC272">Deleting Files with Dired</A>, for commands to flag and unflag
files.)
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1467"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1468"></A>
<DT><KBD>m</KBD>
<DD>Mark the current file with <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> (<CODE>dired-mark</CODE>).  With a numeric
argument <VAR>n</VAR>, mark the next <VAR>n</VAR> files starting with the current
file.  (If <VAR>n</VAR> is negative, mark the previous -<VAR>n</VAR>
files.)
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1469"></A>

those files.

<A NAME="IDX1472"></A>
<DT><KBD>@</KBD>
<DD>Mark all symbolic links with <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> (<CODE>dired-mark-symlinks</CODE>).
With a prefix argument, unmark all those files.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1473"></A>

<DT><KBD>/</KBD>
<DD>Mark with <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> all files which are actually directories, except for
<TT>`.'</TT> and <TT>`..'</TT> (<CODE>dired-mark-directories</CODE>).  With a prefix
argument, unmark all those files.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1475"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1476"></A>
<DT><KBD>M-<KBD>DEL</KBD> <VAR>markchar</VAR></KBD>
<DD>Remove all marks that use the character <VAR>markchar</VAR>
(<CODE>dired-unmark-all-files</CODE>).  If you specify <KBD>RET</KBD> as
<VAR>markchar</VAR>, this command removes all marks, no matter what the
marker character is.
<P>
With a numeric argument, this command queries about each marked file,
asking whether to remove its mark.  You can answer <KBD>y</KBD> meaning yes,
<KBD>n</KBD> meaning no, <KBD>!</KBD> to remove the marks from the remaining files
without asking about them.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1477"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1478"></A>
<DT><KBD>c <VAR>old</VAR> <VAR>new</VAR></KBD>
<DD>Replace all marks that use the character <VAR>old</VAR> with marks that use
the character <VAR>new</VAR> (<CODE>dired-change-marks</CODE>).  This command is
the only way to create or use marks other than <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`D'</SAMP>.
The arguments are single characters--do not use <KBD>RET</KBD> to terminate
them.
<P>
You can use almost any character as a mark character by means of this
command, to distinguish various classes of files.  If <VAR>old</VAR> is a
space (<SAMP>` '</SAMP>), then the command operates on all unmarked files; if
<VAR>new</VAR> is a space, then the command unmarks the files it acts on.
<P>
To illustrate the power of this command, here is how to put <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>
marks on all the files that are unmarked, while unmarking all those that
have <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> marks:

<DD>Mark (with <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>) all files whose names match the regular expression
<VAR>regexp</VAR> (<CODE>dired-mark-files-regexp</CODE>).
<P>
Only the non-directory part of the file name is used in matching.  Use
<SAMP>`^'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> to anchor matches.  Exclude subdirectories by
hiding them (see section <A HREF="emacs_32.html#SEC281">Hiding Subdirectories</A>).

<H2><A NAME="SEC275" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC275">Operating on Files</A></H2>
<P>
  This section describes the basic Dired commands to operate on one file
or several files.  All of these commands are capital letters; all of
them use the minibuffer, either to read an argument or to ask for
confirmation, before they act.  All use the following convention to
decide which files to manipulate:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
If you give the command a numeric prefix argument <VAR>n</VAR>, it operates
on the next <VAR>n</VAR> files, starting with the current file.  (If <VAR>n</VAR>
is negative, the command operates on the -<VAR>n</VAR> files preceding
the current line.)
<P>
<LI>
Otherwise, if some files are marked with <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>, the command operates
on all those files.
<P>
<LI>
Otherwise, the command operates on the current file only.
</UL>
<P>
Here are the commands that operate on files in this way:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1482"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1483"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><KBD>C <VAR>new</VAR> <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Copy the specified files (<CODE>dired-do-copy</CODE>).  The argument <VAR>new</VAR>
is the directory to copy into, or (if copying a single file) the new
name.
<A NAME="IDX1484"></A>
<P>
If <CODE>dired-copy-preserve-time</CODE> is non-<CODE>nil</CODE>, then copying with
this command sets the modification time of the new file to be the same
as that of the old file.
<A NAME="IDX1485"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1486"></A>
<P>
<DT><KBD>R <VAR>new</VAR> <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Rename the specified files (<CODE>dired-do-rename</CODE>).  The argument
<VAR>new</VAR> is the directory to rename into, or (if renaming a single
file) the new name.
<P>
Dired automatically changes the visited file name of buffers associated
with renamed files so that they refer to the new names.
<A NAME="IDX1487"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1488"></A>
<P>
<DT><KBD>H <VAR>new</VAR> <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>

<DT><KBD>M <VAR>modespec</VAR> <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>
<DD>Change the mode (also called "permission bits") of the specified files
(<CODE>dired-do-chmod</CODE>).  This calls the <CODE>chmod</CODE> program, so
<VAR>modespec</VAR> can be any argument that <CODE>chmod</CODE> can handle.

this.)
<A NAME="IDX1497"></A>
<P>
The variable <CODE>dired-chown-program</CODE> specifies the name of the

<H2><A NAME="SEC276" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC276">Shell Commands in Dired</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX1507"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1508"></A>
<P>
The dired command <KBD>!</KBD> (<CODE>dired-do-shell-command</CODE>) reads a shell
command string in the minibuffer and runs the shell command on all the
specified files.  There are two ways of applying a shell command to
multiple files:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
If you use <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> in the shell command, then it runs just once, with
the list of file names substituted for the <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>.  The order of file
names is the order of appearance in the Dired buffer.
<P>
Thus, <KBD>! tar cf foo.tar * <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD> runs <CODE>tar</CODE> on the entire
list of file names, putting them into one tar file <TT>`foo.tar'</TT>.
<P>
<LI>
If the command string doesn't contain <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>, then it runs once
<EM>for each file</EM>, with the file name added at the end.
<P>
For example, <KBD>! uudecode <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD> runs <CODE>uudecode</CODE> on each
file.
</UL>
<P>
What if you want to run the shell command once for each file but with
the file name inserted in the middle?  Or if you want to use the file
names in a more complicated fashion?  Use a shell loop.  For example,
this shell command would run <CODE>uuencode</CODE> on each of the specified
files, writing the output into a corresponding <TT>`.uu'</TT> file:
<P>
<PRE>
for file in *; uuencode $file $file &#62;$file.uu; done
</PRE>
<P>
The working directory for the shell command is the top level directory
of the Dired buffer.
<P>
The <KBD>!</KBD> command does not attempt to update the Dired buffer to show
new or modified files, because it doesn't really understand shell
commands, and does not know what files the shell command changed.  Use
the <KBD>g</KBD> command to update the Dired buffer (see section <A HREF="emacs_32.html#SEC282">Updating the Dired Buffer</A>).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC277" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC277">Transforming File Names in Dired</A></H2>
<P>
  Here are commands that alter file names in a systematic way:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1509"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1510"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><KBD>% u</KBD>
<DD>Rename each of the selected files to an upper case name
(<CODE>dired-upcase</CODE>).  If the old file names are <TT>`Foo'</TT>
and <TT>`bar'</TT>, the new names are <TT>`FOO'</TT> and <TT>`BAR'</TT>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1511"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1512"></A>
<DT><KBD>% l</KBD>
<DD>Rename each of the selected files to a lower case name
(<CODE>dired-downcase</CODE>).  If the old file names are <TT>`Foo'</TT> and
<TT>`bar'</TT>, the new names are <TT>`foo'</TT> and <TT>`bar'</TT>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1513"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1514"></A>
<DT><KBD>% R <VAR>from</VAR> <KBD>RET</KBD> <VAR>to</VAR> <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>

<A NAME="IDX1520"></A>
<DT><KBD>% S <VAR>from</VAR> <KBD>RET</KBD> <VAR>to</VAR> <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>
<DD>These four commands rename, copy, make hard links and make soft links,
in each case computing the new name by regular expression substitution
from the name of the old file.
</DL>
<P>
  The four regular expression substitution commands effectively perform
<CODE>query-replace-regexp</CODE> on the selected file names in the Dired
buffer.  They read two arguments: a regular expression <VAR>from</VAR>, and a
substitution pattern <VAR>to</VAR>.
<P>
  The commands match each "old" file name against the regular
expression <VAR>from</VAR>, and then replace the matching part with
<VAR>to</VAR>.  You can use <SAMP>`\&#38;'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`\<VAR>digit</VAR>'</SAMP> in <VAR>to</VAR> to
refer to all or part of the old file name, as in <CODE>query-replace</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="emacs_17.html#SEC89">Query Replace</A>).
<P>
  For example, <KBD>% R ^.*$ <KBD>RET</KBD> x-\&#38; <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD> renames each
selected file by prepending <SAMP>`x-'</SAMP> to its name.  The inverse of this,
removing <SAMP>`x-'</SAMP> from the front of each file name, is also possible:
one method is <KBD>% R ^x-.*$ <KBD>RET</KBD> \&#38; <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>; another is <KBD>%
R ^x- <KBD>RET</KBD> <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>.  (Use <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> to anchor
matches that should span the whole filename.)
<P>
  If the regular expression matches more than once in a file name, only
the first match is replaced.
<P>
  Normally, the replacement process does not consider the files'
directory names; it operates on the file name within the directory.  If
you specify a prefix argument of zero, then replacement affects the
entire absolute file name including directory name.
<P>
  Often you will want to apply the command to all files matching the
same <VAR>regexp</VAR> that you use in the command.  To do this, mark those
files with <KBD>% m <VAR>regexp</VAR> <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>, then use the same regular
expression in the command to operate on the files.  To make this easier,
the commands to operate use the last regular expression specified in a
<KBD>%</KBD> command as a default.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC278" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC278">File Comparison with Dired</A></H2>
<P>
  Here are two Dired commands that compare specified files using
<CODE>diff</CODE>.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1521"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1522"></A>
<DT><KBD>=</KBD>
<DD>Compare the current file (the file at point) with another file (the file
at the mark) using the <CODE>diff</CODE> program (<CODE>dired-diff</CODE>).  The
file at the mark is the first argument of <CODE>diff</CODE>, and the file at
point is the second argument.
<A NAME="IDX1523"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1524"></A>
<P>
<DT><KBD>M-=</KBD>
<DD>Compare the current file with its latest backup file
(<CODE>dired-backup-diff</CODE>).  If the current file is itself a backup,
compare it with the file it is a backup of; this way, you can compare
a file with any backup version of your choice.
<P>
The backup file is the first file given to <CODE>diff</CODE>.
</DL>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1525"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1526"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC279" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC279">Subdirectories in Dired</A></H2>
<P>
  A Dired buffer displays just one directory in the normal case;
but you can optionally include its subdirectories as well.
<P>
  The simplest way to include multiple directories in one Dired buffer is
to specify the options <SAMP>`-lR'</SAMP> for running <CODE>ls</CODE>.  (If you give a
numeric argument when you run Dired, then you can specify these options
in the minibuffer.)  That produces a recursive directory listing showing
all subdirectories at all levels.
<P>
  But usually all the subdirectories are too many; usually you will
prefer to include specific subdirectories only.  You can do this with
the <KBD>i</KBD> command:
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1527"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1528"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1529"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1530"></A>
<DT><KBD>i</KBD>
<DD>Insert the contents of a subdirectory later in the buffer.
<P>
Use the <KBD>i</KBD> (<CODE>dired-maybe-insert-subdir</CODE>) command on a line
that describes a file which is a directory.  It inserts the contents of
that directory into the same Dired buffer, and moves there.  Inserted
subdirectory contents follow the top-level directory of the Dired
buffer, just as they do in <SAMP>`ls -lR'</SAMP> output.
<P>
If the subdirectory's contents are already present in the buffer, the
<KBD>i</KBD> command just moves to it.
<P>
In either case, <KBD>i</KBD> sets the Emacs mark before moving, so <KBD>C-x
C-x</KBD> takes you back to the old position in the buffer (the line
describing that subdirectory).
<P>
Use the <KBD>l</KBD> command (<CODE>dired-do-redisplay</CODE>) to update the
subdirectory's contents.  Use <KBD>k</KBD> to delete the subdirectory.
See section <A HREF="emacs_32.html#SEC282">Updating the Dired Buffer</A>.
</DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC280" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC280">Moving Over Subdirectories</A></H2>
<P>
  When a Dired buffer lists subdirectories, you can use the page motion
commands <KBD>C-x [</KBD> and <KBD>C-x ]</KBD> to move by entire directories.
<A NAME="IDX1531"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1532"></A>
<P>
  The following commands move across, up and down in the tree of
directories within one Dired buffer.  They move to <DFN>directory header
lines</DFN>, which are the lines that give a directory's name, at the
beginning of the directory's contents.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1533"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1534"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><KBD>C-M-n</KBD>
<DD>Go to next subdirectory header line, regardless of level
(<CODE>dired-next-subdir</CODE>).
<A NAME="IDX1535"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1536"></A>
<P>
<DT><KBD>C-M-p</KBD>
<DD>Go to previous subdirectory header line, regardless of level
(<CODE>dired-prev-subdir</CODE>).
<A NAME="IDX1537"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1538"></A>
<P>
<DT><KBD>C-M-u</KBD>
<DD>Go up to the parent directory's header line (<CODE>dired-tree-up</CODE>).
<A NAME="IDX1539"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1540"></A>
<P>
<DT><KBD>C-M-d</KBD>
<DD>Go down in the directory tree, to the first subdirectory's header line
(<CODE>dired-tree-down</CODE>).
</DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC281" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC281">Hiding Subdirectories</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX1541"></A>
<P>
  <DFN>Hiding</DFN> a subdirectory means to make it invisible, except for its
header line, via selective display (see section <A HREF="emacs_16.html#SEC73">Selective Display</A>).
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1542"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1543"></A>
<DT><KBD>$</KBD>
<DD>Hide or reveal the subdirectory that point is in, and move point to the
next subdirectory (<CODE>dired-hide-subdir</CODE>).  A numeric argument serves
as a repeat count.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1544"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1545"></A>
<DT><KBD>M-$</KBD>
<DD>Hide all subdirectories in this Dired buffer, leaving only their header
lines (<CODE>dired-hide-all</CODE>).  Or, if any subdirectory is currently
hidden, make all subdirectories visible again.  You can use this command
to get an overview in very deep directory trees or to move quickly to
subdirectories far away.
</DL>
<P>
  Ordinary Dired commands never consider files inside a hidden
subdirectory.  For example, the commands to operate on marked files
ignore files in hidden directories even if they are marked.  Thus you
can use hiding to temporarily exclude subdirectories from operations
without having to remove the markers.
<P>
  The subdirectory hiding commands toggle; that is they unhide what was
hidden and vice versa.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC282" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC282">Updating the Dired Buffer</A></H2>
<P>
  This section describes commands to update the Dired buffer to reflect
outside (non-Dired) changes in the directories and files, and to delete
part of the Dired buffer.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><KBD>g</KBD>
<DD>Update the entire contents of the Dired buffer (<CODE>revert-buffer</CODE>).
<P>
<DT><KBD>l</KBD>
<DD>Update the specified files (<CODE>dired-do-redisplay</CODE>).
<P>
<DT><KBD>k</KBD>
<DD>Delete the specified <EM>file lines</EM>---not the files, just the lines
(<CODE>dired-do-kill-lines</CODE>).
</DL>
<A NAME="IDX1546"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1547"></A>
<P>
  Type <KBD>g</KBD> (<CODE>revert-buffer</CODE>) to update the contents of the
Dired buffer, based on changes in the files and directories listed.
This preserves all marks except for those on files that have vanished.
Hidden subdirectories are updated but remain hidden.
<A NAME="IDX1548"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1549"></A>
<P>
  To update only some of the files, type <KBD>l</KBD>
(<CODE>dired-do-redisplay</CODE>).  This command applies to the next <VAR>n</VAR>
files, or to the marked files if any, or to the current file.  Updating
them means reading their current status from the file system and
changing the buffer to reflect it properly.
<P>
  If you use <KBD>l</KBD> on a subdirectory header line, it updates the
contents of the corresponding subdirectory.
<A NAME="IDX1550"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1551"></A>
<P>
  To delete the specified <EM>file lines</EM>---not the files, just the
lines--type <KBD>k</KBD> (<CODE>dired-do-kill-lines</CODE>).  This command applies
to the next <VAR>n</VAR> files, or to the marked files if any, or to the
current file.
<P>
  If you kill the line for a file that is a directory, the directory's
contents are also deleted from the buffer.  Typing <KBD>C-u k</KBD> on the
header line for a subdirectory is another way to delete a subdirectory
from the Dired buffer.
<P>
  The <KBD>g</KBD> command brings back any individual lines that you have
killed in this way, but not subdirectories--you must use <KBD>i</KBD> to
reinsert each subdirectory.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1552"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC283" HREF="emacs_toc.html#SEC283">Dired and <CODE>find</CODE></A></H2>
<P>
  You can select a set of files for display in a Dired buffer more
flexibly by using the <CODE>find</CODE> utility to choose the files.
<A NAME="IDX1553"></A>
<P>
  To search for files with names matching a wildcard pattern use
<KBD>M-x find-name-dired</KBD>.  It reads arguments <VAR>directory</VAR> and
<VAR>pattern</VAR>, and chooses all the files in <VAR>directory</VAR> or its
subdirectories whose individual names match <VAR>pattern</VAR>.
<P>
  The files thus chosen are displayed in a Dired buffer in which the
ordinary Dired commands are available.
<A NAME="IDX1554"></A>
<P>
  If you want to test the contents of files, rather than their names,
use <KBD>M-x find-grep-dired</KBD>.  This command reads two minibuffer
arguments, <VAR>directory</VAR> and <VAR>regexp</VAR>; it chooses all the files in
<VAR>directory</VAR> or its subdirectories that contain a match for
<VAR>regexp</VAR>.  It works by running the programs <CODE>find</CODE> and
<CODE>grep</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX1555"></A>
<P>
  The most general command in this series is <KBD>M-x find-dired</KBD>, which
lets you specify any condition that <CODE>find</CODE> can test.  It takes two
minibuffer arguments, <VAR>directory</VAR> and <VAR>find-args</VAR>; it runs
<CODE>find</CODE> in <VAR>directory</VAR>, passing <VAR>find-args</VAR> to tell
<CODE>find</CODE> what condition to test.  To use this command, you need to
know how to use <CODE>find</CODE>.
