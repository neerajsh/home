Like other members of this family, anise is a source of phytoestrogens. In this connection, it has a historical use as a galactagogue, an herb that promotes breast milk production.

Asian Psyllium Seed is a common bulk fiber laxative, with a particularly high content of insoluble fiber, making it a superior soothing laxative. It balances bowel function and relieves pain in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Psyllium's capacity to absorb fluids means that it is useful for treating diarrhea, a common IBS symptom. As it travels through the gut, the mucilage in psyllium creates a soothing benefit, which may relieve cramping. An English study revealed that constipation significantly improved in patients taking psyllium. Eighty-two percent of the subjects had IBS symptom relief. Psyllium seed looks especially promising for weight loss. A triple-blind experiment done in London with non-dieting subjects revealed that the participants felt much fuller than normal one hour after the meal, and ended up eating 15 grams less fat per day than usual. Psyllium is exceptionally effective in managing normal cholesterol levels in the blood.</td>

Astragalus Root is categorized as a superior herb in Chinese medicine. It&rsquo;s called Huang Qi - &quot;yellow energy builder&quot;. This gem of Traditional Chinese medicine, astragalus, or milk vetch root, is a member of the legume family. Used as a maintenance tonic and to assist healing, astragalus boosts energy, increases stress adaptation, is particularly antiviral and amplifies the efficiency of just about every type of immune function. Chinese families regularly add astragalus to the family stewpot during the cold season, so that everyone can get a daily immune boost. Japanese herbalists use astragalus, which they call &quot;ogi&quot; for lack of appetite, fatigue, diarrhea, uterus, rectum, or stomach imbalances, loss of feeling in the arms and legs, muscle pain, and blood sugar imbalances. Unlike most Chinese herbs, astragalus actually tastes surprisingly good as a tea, with a velvety texture and a sweet, buttery taste.</span></td>

This    herb nourishes the lungs, throat, voice, eyes, and hair. It is used for water    retention, pain, indigestion, lung congestion, and upset stomach. It excels    at removing accumulations of toxins in the digestive, urinary, and    respiratory tracts. It is unique in being both laxative and astringent, so it    purges the intestines, while simultaneously toning the tissues. The fruit has    an astringent and sour taste, and a warming energy.

                Bilberry    Leaf contains powerful antioxidants that prevent free radical damage to cells    and capillaries that can weaken their membranes. The result is stronger, more    flexible capillary and cell walls. This is especially important to eye health    because the retina is one of the most capillary-rich parts of the body. If    capillaries can stretch without breaking or leaking, blood flows better    through the capillaries that feed the retina. This results in improved    vision. Bilberry also increases function of the color-sensing cones of the    eye, improving the brightness of the image and increasing visual acuity. The    nerve cells in the retina become more responsive to available light. Bilberry    is especially noted for improving night vision. Apparently, the components of    bilberry fruit responsible for its benefits are certain polyphenolic    flavonols called anthocyanosides. Bilberry is good for just about all things    ocular.</td>

Thyme tops contain an essential oil    composed mainly of the active ingredients thymol and carvacrol. Thymol is one    of the most powerful antimicrobial substances known- far more so than some of    the strongest antibiotics. The ancient Greeks used thyme for its antiseptic    properties and later Europeans employed it for coughs and shortness of    breath. Today, natural healing practitioners use it for upper respiratory    infections, especially with dry hacking coughs. Use thyme tea as a gargle or    mouthwash for sore throats. The German Commission E lists thyme for symptoms    of bronchitis and whooping cough and mucus infections of the upper    respiratory tract. With its large margin of safety, thyme is a respected    medicine for children&rsquo;s cough.</td>
